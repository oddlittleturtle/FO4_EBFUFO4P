# Unofficial Compatibility Patch - Everyone's Best Friend And UFO4P
Everyone's Best Friend and the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch edit the two same Papyrus scripts (FollowersScript and HC_ManagerScript) causing EBF to return the scripts back to vanilla and reintroducing approximately 10 bugs fixed by the Unofficial Patch in the process. This includes magic effects dispel issues with Survival Mode and an array issue and idle chatter spam on FollowersScript.

All I've done is take the 2 source scripts from UFO4P and carried over changes from EFB and recompiled the scripts. The plugin itself is totally blank. You will need both other mods in order for this patch to actually function properly.
