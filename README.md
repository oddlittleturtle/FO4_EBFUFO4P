# Unofficial Compatibility Patch - Everyone's Best Friend And UFO4P
Everyone's Best Friend and the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch edit the two same Papyrus scripts (FollowersScript and HC_ManagerScript) causing EBF to return the scripts back to vanilla and reintroducing approximately 10 bugs fixed by the Unofficial Patch in the process. This includes magic effects dispel issues with Survival Mode and an array issue and idle chatter spam on FollowersScript.


# Requirements
* Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch
* Everyone's Best Friend


# Notes
* Mod is complete and offered as is, where is. The only updates will be if the Unofficial Patch updates the two scripts included in the file.
* All I've done is take the 2 source scripts from UFO4P, carry over changes from EFB, and then recompiled the scripts. The plugin itself is totally blank and only mastered to Fallout4.esm. The mod will not function properly without both the Unofficial Patch and Everyone's Best Friend in your load order.
* I do not support uninstalling mods in the middle of a game and continuing on the same save.  Start a new character if you do not wish to use the mod after creating a save with it installed. There is no safe uninstall of Fallout 4 mods.

## Naming mistake
I mistakenly used the wrong initials for the plugin and BA2 for Xbox. This is corrected for AFKMods upload.
